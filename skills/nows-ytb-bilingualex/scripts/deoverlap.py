deoverlap.py — Minimal fix for subtitle lines that have NO visible window.

Why this exists (and what it does NOT do):

YouTube ASR subtitles are a "rolling window": each line is a 2-5s window that
starts while the previous line is still on screen. That overlap is NORMAL — the
start timestamps are aligned to the audio (verified: audio speech onset 16.318s
vs. first caption start 16.32s). Therefore this script NEVER pushes a line's
start forward to de-overlap it: doing so would break lip-sync (the subtitle
would appear 1-2s after the words are spoken).

The only real defect is a line whose ENTIRE window is inside the previous
line's (end <= previous end): it has no time of its own, so a player shows it
for 0 seconds. This script gives those rare lines a minimum visible window by
EXTENDING their end forward (start is never touched). The audio-alignment
of every other line is preserved exactly.

Only the timestamps change; text/style/layer are untouched; line count is
unchanged.

Usage:
    python3 deoverlap.py <input.ass> [--out <output.ass>] [--min-duration 0.5]

If --out is omitted, the input file is modified in place.
