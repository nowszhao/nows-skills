"""Aggregate a fragmented rolling-window SRT (from YouTube's transcript panel
or the timedtext fallback) into sentence-level SRT.

Why this exists (verified 2026-08): YouTube's current transcript panel and the
timedtext data it mirrors are NOT sentence-aggregated — the panel renders the
same pre-aggregation rolling-window fragments as the ASR captions (e.g. lines
`0:00 Hi, my guest today needs almost no` / `0:03 introduction in the data
world. He` with ~2-3s overlapping windows). Feeding those straight into
split/translate/assemble produces half-sentences that look wrong in any player.
This script merges consecutive fragments into ~5-9s sentences, keeping each
sentence's start timestamp (= the true speech onset of the first fragment).

Aggregation rules:
- Merge consecutive captions while the inter-caption silence is <= MAX_GAP_MS
  and the running group is <= MAX_GROUP_MS.
- Split a group early when a caption ENDS with a sentence terminator
  (. ? !) and the group already has >= MIN_TERM_MS of content (avoids making
  one-word "No." groups), or when the caption STARTS with ">>" (speaker change),
  or when a > MAX_GAP_MS silence occurs.
- The LAST caption's end is extended +2s so the final line has a visible window.
- **De-overlap (CRITICAL)**: the rolling-window source means a merged sentence's
  last fragment END extends past the next sentence's start. After aggregation
  each sentence's END is set to the NEXT sentence's START (same convention the
  transcript panel uses), so the output SRT is strictly non-overlapping. If this
  is skipped, overlapping windows leak into the final .ass (observed 2026-08:
  3844 overlapping pairs across a 14-video batch).
- Timestamps are inherited from the source, never recomputed. Starts are NEVER
  pushed forward, so audio alignment is preserved by construction.

Usage:

                             [--max-group 7500] [--min-term 1200]
